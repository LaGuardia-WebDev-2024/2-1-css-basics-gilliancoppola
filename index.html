    <p>The <em>European Hamster</em> is awesome because <strong>it is a little-known relative of domestic hamsters</strong>. Many people think that hamsters don't ever live in the wild, but these do. European hamsters are larger than domestic hamsters, being about the size of a guinea pig. They are native to grasslands and farmlands of Eurasia, foraging for food in the night and around sunset. They are nocturnal/crepuscular. European hamsters are endangered.</p>
